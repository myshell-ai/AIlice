Function Calls
Using function calls, you can browse any code files and web pages locally or on the network.
The syntax for basic data types when calling functions is consistent with Python. Note that triple quotes should be used for multiline strings.
Use special symbols "<!|","|!>" as replacements for parentheses in function call syntax. Please pay special attention to the syntax when generating function call statements.
Only positional parameter function calls are supported, please do not use keyword parameters and keep the order of parameters consistent with the function definition.
Text referencing is not supported in parameters of function call statements. Please use clear and straightforward expressions in function calls.
If you need to call a function, place it at the end of the message, and use '!' as a prefix to trigger its execution.
